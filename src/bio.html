<h2 class="bio-subheadline">Introduction:</h2>
<p class="bio-paragraph">My name is Ihab A. Bou Hassan “aka ibsio”. I am a very sociable and easy-going person, I grew up being people’s favorite among my entourage. Ever since I was a child, I loved food and cars. I perceived those two interests by studying Hospitality and Culinary Arts and working in the food industry for 10 years. As for cars, I started perceiving this career by managing an automotive magazine, then managing an automotive account in an advertising agency and after that by working in auto dealerships’ marketing until I became the Assistant General Manager /Head of Marketing.
   Throughout my life and business career I became fond of technology and fell in love with it. From computers to cellphones and the smartphones after that my curiosity and love toward technology and learning something new kept me up to date. When the digital advertising world picked up in 2015, I completed a digital marketing course and after that I refreshed it again through completing the Google digital garage course. I am a character that is always eager to learn and develop myself and others, a  team leader who has always spared time to coach and mentor employees who I have managed.</p>
  
  <h2 class="bio-subheadline">Hobbies:</h2>
  <p class="bio-paragraph">Beside cooking and cars, I love basketball and football. Not only as a spectator but I practiced both sports at an early age. More attached to European football than basketball since the age of 10, I almost never missed an international tournament especially the world cup and UEFA Champions League.
  Another hobby that grew on me at a later age was fixing classic analog watches and computers. Both were self-taught out of curiosity.</p>
  
  <h2 class="bio-subheadline">Why Developer?</h2>
  <p class="bio-paragraph">My curiosity and my love to knowhow were the motive from the very beginning to develop my skills. As a marketer I have always been on the front side of the screen yet always felt curious to be on the other side of it. Therefore, the idea of getting involved in web development was there but it wasn’t ripe yet because I was even more curious to know what is beyond that! I knew it when the world was going digital and therefore I developed my skills in marketing and got into the digital aspect of it but what encouraged me the most to make the switch were several elements.
  One of those elements was my experience in switching careers. In 2007 I made a huge leap from successful career in food to media/advertising/marketing. I literally went from being a senior employee and started over as a junior. I found it very successful and fruitful as I learned a lot from it, although I started as a junior, but it didn’t take me much to climb up the ladder as I already had a decade of experience under my sleeve. My “can do” mentality is one of my strongest USPs.
  Another element that pushed me to go down this road is my daily interaction with social media, not only as a user but as an advertiser and knowing how it works. Suddenly getting involved in the web development which I was thinking of became no longer enough! I started itching to dig deeper.
  I have always wanted to help and be someone who is contributing in this world. The world is moving so fast with the current technology in hand and developers are becoming as important as doctors, nurses, enginieers, the men and women in arms because with the current world we are living in each and every electronic device that is used to support the doctors, the nurses, the enginieers, the men and women in arms needs a coder to help maintain it and develop a better one in order to maintain a quality of life to every living creature. Also, we wouldn't been able to do it to space without software engineers and developers...how cool is that!!</p>
