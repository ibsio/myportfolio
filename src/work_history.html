<div class="wh-left-column">
  <h2 class="title">Summary:</h2>
  <p class="content">I am a self-motivated, customer/client-focused individual with strong communication and presentation skills. I would consider myself to be an expert in building relationships with various peers. As a team player and influencer, I demonstrate excellent problem-solving skills. I’m a marketing-oriented, strategic thinker who is results-driven with a creative mind. 
    Challenge is what I thrive in and I always enjoy bringing ideas to the table which are outside the box, before studying at the Coder Academy I managed creative briefs, proofread content, worked with creative designers, developers and tech-support teams  as well. 
    I am now on the other side of the business, I am the one to be briefed not the one who briefs. This is a very important aspect from my background which I will be able to bring with me to this industry, an industry that I chose after more than two decades of business experience in more than a single industry in different markets. Being “the developer” is what I have chosen as a path to proceed with my business life and retire from it when the time comes.
    I completed my vocational studies in a culinary school and worked in the food industry for almost 10 years. After that I moved to the media/advertising industry, but I remained in the sales and marketing field. I have been passionate about cars since I was a child which influenced me to lean towards automotive-related tasks during my time in media and advertising industry, by selling and marketing publications or by handling clients’ services. I then got the opportunity to move to automotive dealership marketing.
    I am a fast learner with an influencing character and an analytical mind.
